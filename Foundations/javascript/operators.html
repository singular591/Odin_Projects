// exercise 1 :
// let a = 1;
// let b = 1;

// let c = ++a; 
// let d = b++;

// Question 1 : a = 2, b = 2, c = 2, d = 1
// because ++ used in prefix form returns the result after the operation while
// ++ used in post form (as in $variable++) returns the previous number if used right away
// thus
// ++a means c = 1+1 so c = 2 and a get incremented so a = 2
// b++ means b = 2 but because ++ is lower priority the = get done first
// so d = b at the time, so d = 1 THEN b gets incremented so b = 2
// so a = 2, b = 2, c = 2 and d = 1

//ex 2
// "" + 1 + 0 = "10"
// we add up the last part > (1+0) then "" means 0 so 1+0+0=1. No, we do "" (so, 0) + 1 then + 0. So 0+1+0=1. Correction : "" is a string. So the entire thing becomes a string first. So (nothing)then "1" then "0". (nothing)10 > "10" (string). The
// The Confusion  came from alert( +"" );   which convert non number, here, an empty string to a number, here, empty means 0. In this exercise "" IS NOT +""
// 
// "" - 1 + 0 = -1 
// Why : + is the only operator that concatenates. Other operators concert strings to numbers. So here "" means 0, so 0-1-0 = -1
// 
// true + false = 1 but I can't find why. Maybe true = 1 and false = 0. Seems to be the case while testing.
// 
// 6 / "3" = 2. "3" gets converted to integer thus 6/3=2
// "2" * "3" = 6. Both values get converted to numbers so 2*3=6
// 4 + 5 + "px" = "9px"
// "$" + 4 + 5 =  "$45"
// "4" - 2 = 2 
// "4px" - 2 = NaN You can't substract a string and an number
// "  -9  " + 5 = -14 String gets converted to number
// "  -9  " - 5 = NaN
// null + 1 = 1 Null becomes 0 after numeric conversion
// undefined + 1 = NaN undefined becomes NaN after numeric conversion
// " \t \n" - 2 = -2 Dont get it but here's the explanation Space characters are trimmed off string start and end when a string is converted to a number. Here the whole string consists of space characters, such as \t, \n and a “regular” space between them. So, similarly to an empty string, it becomes 0.
// Maybe "\whatever" is consider like a space character so like nothing. so "\t" and "\n" equal 0 and the remaining real space too so 0+0+0-2=-2

// let a = Number(prompt("First number?", 1));
// let b = Number(prompt("Second number?", 2));



// alert(a + b); // 12
// console.log("Hello, World!")
