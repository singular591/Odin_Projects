# This is the README for the odin_recipes project of theodinproject.com

The goal is to learn HTML basics

What I've learned during this project :
- How to properly organize my folders and files
- How to link to images/webpage in other folders
- Basic HTML formatting (links, lists, paragraphs)
- A basic Git workflow 


What I need to remember :
- Don't forget to git add the files (otherwise your commits won't work)
- Commit more often
