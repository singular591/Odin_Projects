    <p>Adapted from Kenji's grilled skirt steak fajitas recipe—with its rich and flavorful lime, soy sauce, and cumin-spiced marinade—this version reworks the recipe using chicken thighs instead of steak and alters the technique so that all you need is an oven and a single sheet pan. Because it's all cooked on a large half-sheet pan, it's perfect for feeding a larger group, plus the prep and cleanup are kept to a minimum. </p>
